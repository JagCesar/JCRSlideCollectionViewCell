# JCRSlideCollectionViewCell

I've seen many apps that have cells that can be swiped sideways to do certain actions. Our designer had an idea that included this, but after some googling I didn't find any proper code that helped me out with this. So I decided to implement this myself and opensource it.

Instead of using UITableView I decided to use UICollectionView. This because I've stopped using UITableView and am always using UICollectionView nowadays.

## How do I use it?

The easiest way would be to add it to your project using cocoapods. If you don't have that installed you write the following in your terminal:
- sudo gem install cocoapods
